# Module_14_Challenge

# Algorithmic Trading

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I am a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. My firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, my firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. I am planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firmâ€™s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, I am enhancing the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

I am creating an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets. I am implementing an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions, adjusting the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm, and training a new machine learning model. I am comparing the new models performance to that of the baseline model.

I have created a Jupyter notebook containing my analysis, including text and comments to document my findings.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following modules:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For reading data into a DataFrame and analyzing data via statistics and plots.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org) - For computation.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - For plotting in various formats working with a wide array of datatypes in the PyData ecosystem.

* [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - For reading and writing tabular data in CSV (Comma Seperated Values) format.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For representing the file system path to a csv.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html#) - For machine learning.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - For embedding plots in the application.
